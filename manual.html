    <h2 class="margintop">Application Description</h2>
    <p>This software is an electronic document management and task tracking multiuser web-based environment.</p>
    <p>Usually it is easy to use and user experience is quite intuitive, so this manual is only to clarify some functions.</p>
    <p>Every separate group of elements which has a title in the navigation bar is called in this project the "base".</p>

    <h2 class="margintop">Basic setup and logging in</h2>
    <p>This software requires that you use modern web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari with enabled JavaScript. If you experience corrupted content rendering, controls which do not function, etc., please verify that your browser is up to date.</p>
    <p>You need only a browser and a link to a website with the installed EDM server to use the software.
    <p>If you are administrator who installed the system, use default login: <b>admin</b>, with empty (no) password.</p>
    <p>If you are not that administrator, your login name and password should be obtained from an administrator. Use them exactly as they are. You can change them on your profile page.</p>

    <h2 class="margintop">Permissions in general</h2>
    <p>User profiles in the system may have the administrator role or may have no role. Only administrators can create, delete, edit other user profiles and companies. Users can edit their own profiles. </p>
    <p>Users with no role can create other objects: documents, tasks. A creator of an object becomes its owner.</p>
    <p>Only creators (owners) can edit and delete their objects. An administrator may on a server level disable the permission to delete objects even for owners.</p>
    <p>It is strongly advised not to delete anything, as someone may post links to your objects somewhere else.</p>
    <p>All users can view any objects.</p>

    <h2 class="margintop">User profiles, companies, settings</h2>
    <p>User profile represents a person who uses the software. There is a list of registered users (Team base), from where it is available a list of companies.</p>
    <p>Each user profile has a set of configuration options available on the setting page. They are easy to understand. It is recommended to review them to make your experience handy and convenient.</p>
    <p>Companies are created by an administrator and they may include units (departments). A user may be an employee of a unit and, therefore, of a respective company.</p>

    <h2 class="margintop">Documents</h2>
    <p>A document is an object which represents a document from the real world. </p>
    <p>Documents base may be used to register and store company contracts with all their addenda, incoming and outgoing letters, any internal, corporate regulations, etc.</p>
    <p>Documents have the feature of approval, and the approval list view. Creator (owner) and any other approver may add approvers.</p>
    <p>Creator (owner) may delete approvers only before they approve or reject.</p>
    <p>Approvers can save their note before approval (this does not change approval status, the note can be edited later). Approvers may approve or edit the note after they reject. Approvers may not cancel or edit the note after they approve.</p>
    <p>If after an approval was made, someone deletes any document file, the approval becomes broken.</p>

    <h2 class="margintop">Tasks</h2>
    <p>A task is an object representing a separate job or a task process from the real world, where one or several people do something, discuss it, attach files, etc.</p>
    <p>A task has a creator (owner) who initiated it, an assignee who is the main person responsible for a task to be done, and other participants, who may do part of the job, or approve, or discuss the process.</p>
    <p>Any user can take an unassigned task to do. An assigned task could not be taken: if required, users can ask task the owner or current assignee to forward them such task.</p>
    <p>Task creators or assignees can forward task to another assignee, add participants, change task status.</p>
    <p>Task commenting is only available to creators, assignees and participants of the task.</p>
    
    <h2 class="margintop">Projects</h2>
    <p>A project is an object representing a project from the real world, where several people do something. A project includes a number of tasks.</p>
    <p>Projects show all tasks added to them. On the project page there are 4 columns which display tasks according to their statuses.</p>
    <p>Any task creator (owner) can add a task to a project. Project owners can edit their projects and assign or detach any task added to the their projects.</p>
    <p>Changes in tasks added to a project are reflected almost in real time in each opened project window so that project participants looking at the same project page on their devices can see the changes.</p>
    <p>On a project page any user can filter tasks by some text. This is done by typing that text into the search field. The search is performed by task topic, creator, and assignee. The result is immediate at typing.</p>
